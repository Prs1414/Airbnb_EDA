#Room Types and Neighbourhood Group

#We will first check the distribution of the room type by grouping the data. From the below its clear the Apartment and Private data is more than that of shared rooms. In general, Shared rooms costs less and can be very useful for travellers who moves from one city to another city quite frequently. Though the shared rooms data is less, we will still try to uncover as much details as we can.

#Let's have a quick summary of the price data. In according to the summary statistics it is clear that the Price ranges from  0âˆ’
 #180. But there also exists price which has a maximum of $10000. This we cannot discard as an outlier because there are many scenarios in which price differs. The price varies on different factors which includes location,room type, neighbourhood , season etc. Also, we can see from the below there are few few values with 0, which can be due to dynamic pricing or the willingness of not to share the price with the Airbnb.

#We also plot a boxplot to understand how the data is spread out for high ranges for the price irrespective of region.

#Average room rent for locality
#For any traveller, the most important thing is the price since this sets the budget of his/her trip. So in the below we will figure out what is the average price per night. We will check for different room type and based on neighbourhood group to figure out what is the average per night stay. Staying at a Apartment is always an expensive stay than shared room/private rooms for any location. This is so because Entire room is rented out by family for nice stay where privacy is also one of the major factor. Whereas Stay at Shared rooms are being preferred by travellers who generally don't wish to stay for long time at a particular place and moves around places quickly.
#So looking at the plot it is clear :
#a. Shared room at staten Island is the most cheapest stay per night whereas Renting a Entire apartment/Home at Manhattan per night is the most expensive.
#b. Average price for Private room is also considerably expensive at manhattan so is the shared room at Manhattan is expensive than other private rooms of the neighbourhood. This clearly states that Manhattan is the expensive stay than any other locality.
#c. Bronx is the most cheapest stay in terms of neighbourhood group comparison in respect to room type.
#d. Though Shared room at Staten Island is the cheapest whereas Apartment renting is not cheapest at Staten Island. This can be due to the location of a perfect gateway from the rush of the city for a quality time with family get together , let me know what you think :).
#We will also list out the average price for each type of room per neighbourhood so that tourists can plan based on the budget.

#Expensive Neighbourhood
#Till so far we have checked on the location group, but we have not came across each neighbourhood. This is very much important in terms of price to understand which locality has the highest price margin in terms of night being spend by traveller. Let's dig further to understand further.
#So we will now plot the most expensive neighbourhood, and we will plot only Top 15 neighbourhood and Bottom 15 with respect to average price. This will help a traveller to choose the appropriate neighbourhood based on his budget.
#So according to the below plot Fort Wadsworth is the most expensive in terms of neighbourhood. Whereas Bull's head locality is the least expensive to stay.

#I have listed below the listing of top 15 as well as least 15 based on the neighbourhood.
#If we recall this neighbourhood is one of the highest stay based on price so this can be one of the reason that the price is increased due to the less number of listing.

#Location and Review Score
#Review is the one of the important criteria with online activity these days. This gives a lot of insights to a particular place for tourist and they can swing mood when it comes to online booking. A cheap place with bad review can drive a tourist for not booking and an expensive place with nicest review can shell a tourist more than what he have thought initially. So we will try to figure out the review , how each neighbourhood is doing in respect to review. Since there is a limited data with review we will try to figure out as much as we can.
#First criteria of our review is we will consider only those who have a review more than 50, so that we can have an insight of the data.
#So according to the below plot, Brooklyn got most review in comparison to Manhattan and that is an interesting find. Also Staten Island which is cheaper has less review than the other neighbourhood group. We cannot proceed further to understand why is that case since we have a limited data.
